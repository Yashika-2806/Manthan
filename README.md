## 🔧 IF SOMETHING ISN'T WORKING

### Problem: "Cannot load page"
**Solution:**
1. Make sure `python app.py` is running
2. Look for "Server running at: http://localhost:5000"
3. Try: http://127.0.0.1:5000

### Problem: "No alternatives showing"
**The model was fixed!** If you still don't see them:
1. Press Ctrl+C in server terminal
2. Restart: `python app.py`
3. Refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)

### Problem: "Conversions not good"
**All modes were improved!**
- Formal: Removes casual greetings, fixes capitalization
- Friendly: Adds warm greetings and closings
- All modes: Generate 2 alternatives

### Problem: Server keeps restarting
**This is normal** - watchdog auto-reloads on file changes.
Just wait 3-5 seconds for it to stabilize.
